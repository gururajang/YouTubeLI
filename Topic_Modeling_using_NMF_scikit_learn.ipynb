I have spoken to about five or six of their representatives, trying to resolve it. They are determining that it is inconclusive, and they are unable to move any further by phone. \\n\\nAt this particular time, they have \" frozen '' my spending. There is a statement on my page that will not print out that tells me charges to my account may be limited. When I try to print it, it does not show on that page because of the formatting that they have used on their web site. \\n\\nI have not received any correspondence from them in over a month. I am writing to them today to request that they close my account and apply the balance toward what I owe, because I am not able to use the account. \\n\\nFor some reason, I made a payment on the XXXX of XXXX and that payment has been cancelled. \\n\\nEvery time I have tried to contact Citi, they give some reason or another as to why we can not resolve the matter. I have asked them what do I need to do to resolve it, but they are unable to provide a resolution. \\n\\nThe problem is that I have changed my phone number. My address is still the same, but I have been staying with my sister temporarily off-and-on since her mild XXXX in XXXX. I refuse to change my address to hers, even though I have noticed that my creditors have done so against my will. I told them to keep it as my temporary address, before advising others not to change it at all. I am back and forth between her house and my mailing address listed on this account. \\n\\nMy problem is with their fraud department. They are unable to give me a solid reason why my account is tagged for fraud. They have failed to send me notification stating steps to verify my information, and to notify me of any results from an \" investigation '' that they are having or holding on my account. I have been unable to use my account since XXXX. \\n\\nThe last time I called before my account was \" flagged '', I was trying to make a payment by phone. My phone number had changed, and I verified my information. Something XXXX me off and I hung up the phone ( I believe they asked me to enter my full credit card number ), which is usually unusual when you verify the information. When I called back, they did the same thing - at which I explained that I was driving. Almost every time I called, I was driving. I was not about to risk getting into a wreck to get a credit card out, but was willing to verify all of my other information. \\n\\nSame scenario, repeatedly. I was trying to make a payment, and when I decided not to on that phone call and hung up, it was only then that I mysteriously received information saying my account had been flagged. Prior to this, the only charges that had been made on the account were to make my XXXX XXXX payments, so there are no indications of fraud on this account. \\n\\nNow that my account has been flagged, I would like my money back. This is a secured card, where I invested my money with Citi and they have locked me from using the card. I have made 2 payments since then, and now, like once before, for some reason, one of my payments didn't go through. \\n\\nNot only that, my account disappeared from their system for a little over 48 hours that I had used prior on the account. They could not process a payment on this account, so I had to use my debit card tied to this account. I have no idea why they could not use this account. However, it appears that the same thing has been going on, because a recent payment that I made has been cancelled. I am not sure why this time, but they have accessed a late fee on my account. \\n\\nAt this point, I am tired of Citi. I had a good relationship with them when I was in college, and they were called Citibank or Citigroup before they branched off into Citi. \\n\\nMy secured account is set to mature in XXXX ; however, I just want my money back. I want them to take the money that I owe them and pay off my account, and say that it is paid, and closed at customer request. This is too much headache to go through for a secured credit card. \\n\\nIf they have rules surrounding verification of my account, and new phone numbers, they should have just tried to issue a refund of my monies ... and let my account go ... \\n\\nI will pay the balance of {$7.00}, once they issue a credit to my card. But I am done with Citi ... I will never bank with them by myriad of choice again.</td>\n",

              "30936  Throughout XX/XX/2019, I have received multiple calls from this company. I have also asked them to not call me or anyone associated with me. They have called my mother in law way too many times asking for my partner. They have called my partner multiple times asking for me. I'm not sure what kind of operation is being ran there, but it needs to stop. I'm giving notice to cease all contact with me or anyone else except the creditor about this claimed debt. Only contact me in writing, not by phone. Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ...

              "34878  I have called several times, even spoken to a manager to try to clear this matter up and am not able to resolve it. \\n\\nCiti is claiming there is fraudulent activity on my account, at which they are requesting that I call in to resolve it. I have spoken to about five or six of their representatives, trying to resolve it. They are determining that it is inconclusive, and they are unable to move any further by phone. \\n\\nAt this particular time, they have \" frozen '' my spending. There is a statement on my page that will not print out that tells me charges to my account may be limited. When I try to print it, it does not show on that page because of the formatting that they have used on their web site. \\n\\nI have not received any correspondence from them in over a month. I am writing to them today to request that they close my account and apply the balance toward what I owe, because I am not able to use the account. \\n\\nFor some reason, I made a payment on the XXXX of XXXX and that payment has been cancelled. \\n\\nEvery time I have tried to contact Citi, they give some reason or another as to why we can not resolve the matter. I have asked them what do I need to do to resolve it, but they are unable to provide a resolution. \\n\\nThe problem is that I have changed my phone number. My address is still the same, but I have been staying with my sister temporarily off-and-on since her mild XXXX in XXXX. I refuse to change my address to hers, even though I have noticed that my creditors have done so against my will. I told them to keep it as my temporary address, before advising others not to change it at all. I am back and forth between her house and my mailing address listed on this account. \\n\\nMy problem is with their fraud department. They are unable to give me a solid reason why my account is tagged for fraud. They have failed to send me notification stating steps to verify my information, and to notify me of any results from an \" investigation '' that they are having or holding on my account. I have been unable to use my account since XXXX. \\n\\nThe last time I called before my account was \" flagged '', I was trying to make a payment by phone. My phone number had changed, and I verified my information. Something XXXX me off and I hung up the phone ( I believe they asked me to enter my full credit card number ), which is usually unusual when you verify the information. When I called back, they did the same thing - at which I explained that I was driving. Almost every time I called, I was driving. I was not about to risk getting into a wreck to get a credit card out, but was willing to verify all of my other information. \\n\\nSame scenario, repeatedly. I was trying to make a payment, and when I decided not to on that phone call and hung up, it was only then that I mysteriously received information saying my account had been flagged. Prior to this, the only charges that had been made on the account were to make my XXXX XXXX payments, so there are no indications of fraud on this account. \\n\\nNow that my account has been flagged, I would like my money back. This is a secured card, where I invested my money with Citi and they have locked me from using the card. I have made 2 payments since then, and now, like once before, for some reason, one of my payments didn't go through. \\n\\nNot only that, my account disappeared from their system for a little over 48 hours that I had used prior on the account. They could not process a payment on this account, so I had to use my debit card tied to this account. I have no idea why they could not use this account. However, it appears that the same thing has been going on, because a recent payment that I made has been cancelled. I am not sure why this time, but they have accessed a late fee on my account. \\n\\nAt this point, I am tired of Citi. I had a good relationship with them when I was in college, and they were called Citibank or Citigroup before they branched off into Citi. \\n\\nMy secured account is set to mature in XXXX ; however, I just want my money back. I want them to take the money that I owe them and pay off my account, and say that it is paid, and closed at customer request. This is too much headache to go through for a secured credit card. \\n\\nIf they have rules surrounding verification of my account, and new phone numbers, they should have just tried to issue a refund of my monies ... and let my account go ... \\n\\nI will pay the balance of {$7.00}, once they issue a credit to my card.

              "15465  PNC recently changed their policy to not allow it's users to link their accounts or debit cards to third parties, thus denying access to my money that they are holding. This is illegal and needs to stop. I was told by my investment company PNC no longer allows me to link my account with them so I can not automatically deposit funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...

I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service.

              "20993  I first applied for the Fedloan Serving program in XXXX in hopes of getting loan forgiveness since I've been paying on my student loans since late XXXX or early XXXX and I have been a public servant since XXXX, XXXX. I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.  ...  AES/PHEAA                        \n",

Now it is back up to the high bank fees and interest charges that have again gone beyond what I can afford monthly the {$240.00}.
